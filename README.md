# Ski Resort Finder

This is a passion project to show worldwide ski resorts and their attributes. You can search by resort name, filter by vertical, change units from metric to imperial, and filter by pass type (Epic and Ikon passes). I integrated with Firebase to store the additional pass-related information that I could not get from [skimap.org's API](https://skimap.org/pages/Developers). For more context, [read my blog post about the project](https://scottpdawson.com/how-to-create-interactive-maps-with-react-and-leaflet/).
