My family is chock full of avid skiers. We put our two kids through ski racing programs, and now they can ski pretty much anything we throw at them. After being dedicated mountain pass holders, then Ikon pass holders, then nomads purchasing advance tickets, I thought it’d be cool to create a map-based way of discovering new ski resorts. It’d be a cool way to visualize where they were, and whether they were included in popular pass programs like Ikon and Epic.
